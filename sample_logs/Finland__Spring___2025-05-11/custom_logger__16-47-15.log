As the snow starts to melt, the country's forests come alive, offering many lovely locations for nature walks, hikes and the Finnish pastime of forest bathing. In Helsinki, don't miss the blossoming of the Roihuvuori cherry tree orchard, one of the area's most beloved signs of spring.\nThe Roihuvuori cherry orchard is part of a garden inspired by Japan and blooms every May.\nGrab your binoculars and go bird-watching\nThe sound of birds chirping is a blissful reminder that nature is reawakening. Every spring, nearly 250 species of birds return to Finland from their long winter spent down south. If you're interested in bird-watching, the town of Kuusamo \u2013 and it's expansive taiga forests \u2013 is regarded as one of the best in Finland, while the Coast and Archipelago region offers enthusiasts the opportunity to observe Charadriiformes, which can often be spotted in the coastal areas near the Baltic Sea. But even the greater Helsinki area offers ample birding in spots such as Old Town Bay, Viikki, Lauttasaari and Laajalahti in Espoo \u2013 all of which can be easily accessed by public transportation.

The season for this magical phenomenon is particularly long in Lapland, where the Aurora is most visible from the end of August to April. According to research, the lights are visible every second night when the skies are clear, so you may be able to spot them about 200 nights per year. To boost your chances of seeing the show during your trip, hire an aurora guide or join an organised tour. You can even stay overnight in a specially designed glass hut!

But if unpleasant weather strikes, there's no need to fret. In Finland, you'll find plenty of things to do, from visiting internationally acclaimed museums to perusing unique local galleries.

People, too, come alive after the long winter, and events like Easter and Vappu (1st of May) celebrate the upcoming season.\nExperience the magic of spring for yourself with this list of the top things to do in Finland from March through May.\nHit the slopes in the spring sun\nMany ski resorts remain open and cross-country skiing tracks are typically in great condition. One of the more curious elements of the Finnish spring ski season is the sudden appearance of great parties.

As the snow starts to melt, the country's forests come alive, offering many lovely locations for nature walks, hikes and the Finnish pastime of forest bathing. In Helsinki, don't miss the blossoming of the Roihuvuori cherry tree orchard, one of the area's most beloved signs of spring.\nThe Roihuvuori cherry orchard is part of a garden inspired by Japan and blooms every May.\nGrab your binoculars and go bird-watching\nThe sound of birds chirping is a blissful reminder that nature is reawakening. Every spring, nearly 250 species of birds return to Finland from their long winter spent down south. If you're interested in bird-watching, the town of Kuusamo \u2013 and it's expansive taiga forests \u2013 is regarded as one of the best in Finland, while the Coast and Archipelago region offers enthusiasts the opportunity to observe Charadriiformes, which can often be spotted in the coastal areas near the Baltic Sea. But even the greater Helsinki area offers ample birding in spots such as Old Town Bay, Viikki, Lauttasaari and Laajalahti in Espoo \u2013 all of which can be easily accessed by public transportation.

The season for this magical phenomenon is particularly long in Lapland, where the Aurora is most visible from the end of August to April. According to research, the lights are visible every second night when the skies are clear, so you may be able to spot them about 200 nights per year. To boost your chances of seeing the show during your trip, hire an aurora guide or join an organised tour. You can even stay overnight in a specially designed glass hut!

Year-round accommodations can still be found on the islands of Hailuoto near Oulu, on Ut\u00f6 in the Turku archipelago, on the \u00c5land Islands and on Bar\u00f6sund, an island near Inkoo.

But if unpleasant weather strikes, there's no need to fret. In Finland, you'll find plenty of things to do, from visiting internationally acclaimed museums to perusing unique local galleries. In Helsinki, don\u2019t miss Ateneum Art Museum, Amos Rex, the Design Museum and the Didrichsen Art Museum. If you're staying in Lakeland, the Serlachius Museums near M\u00e4ntt\u00e4 are must-sees. And for architecture lovers, try a guided tour of one of Alvar Aalto\u2019s many iconic buildings, like S\u00e4yn\u00e4tsalo Town Hall in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 or Villa Mairea near Pori.\nDidrichsen Art Museum is situated by the sea on Kuusisaari Island in western Helsinki.

In spring, ski days are long and sunsets are mesmerizing.\nCredits: Harri Lindfors\nWatch nature come alive on a hike\nSigns of spring usually crop up in late March in southern Finland, and it's hard to overstate the pull of the warmer season. As the snow starts to melt, the country's forests come alive, offering many lovely locations for nature walks, hikes and the Finnish pastime of forest bathing. In Helsinki, don't miss the blossoming of the Roihuvuori cherry tree orchard, one of the area's most beloved signs of spring.\nThe Roihuvuori cherry orchard is part of a garden inspired by Japan and blooms every May.\nGrab your binoculars and go bird-watching\nThe sound of birds chirping is a blissful reminder that nature is reawakening. Every spring, nearly 250 species of birds return to Finland from their long winter spent down south. If you're interested in bird-watching, the town of Kuusamo \u2013 and it's expansive taiga forests \u2013 is regarded as one of the best in Finland, while the Coast and Archipelago region offers enthusiasts the opportunity to observe Charadriiformes, which can often be spotted in the coastal areas near the Baltic Sea. But even the greater Helsinki area offers ample birding in spots such as Old Town Bay, Viikki, Lauttasaari and Laajalahti in Espoo \u2013 all of which can be easily accessed by public transportation.

The season for this magical phenomenon is particularly long in Lapland, where the Aurora is most visible from the end of August to April. According to research, the lights are visible every second night when the skies are clear, so you may be able to spot them about 200 nights per year. To boost your chances of seeing the show during your trip, hire an aurora guide or join an organised tour. You can even stay overnight in a specially designed glass hut!

Springtime here is still an undiscovered gem, allowing the few people who venture out some serious peace and quiet. The good news? Year-round accommodations can still be found on the islands of Hailuoto near Oulu, on Ut\u00f6 in the Turku archipelago, on the \u00c5land Islands and on Bar\u00f6sund, an island near Inkoo. For a unique stay in the centre of the rugged and beautiful coastal landscape, try The Bar\u00f6, an ecologically-built, high-class hotel in the heart of the archipelago that's just an hour's drive from Helsinki.\nMarjaniemi lighthouse is the most famous landmark on the island of Hailuoto.\nCredits : Mariia Kauppi\nThe hotel rooms at The Bar\u00f6 are great examples of Finland's modern, wooden architecture.\nWander through museums and galleries\nSunny skies are never guaranteed, especially during spring. But if unpleasant weather strikes, there's no need to fret. In Finland, you'll find plenty of things to do, from visiting internationally acclaimed museums to perusing unique local galleries. In Helsinki, don\u2019t miss Ateneum Art Museum, Amos Rex, the Design Museum and the Didrichsen Art Museum. If you're staying in Lakeland, the Serlachius Museums near M\u00e4ntt\u00e4 are must-sees. And for architecture lovers, try a guided tour of one of Alvar Aalto\u2019s many iconic buildings, like S\u00e4yn\u00e4tsalo Town Hall in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 or Villa Mairea near Pori.\nDidrichsen Art Museum is situated by the sea on Kuusisaari Island in western Helsinki. The building was designed by architect Viljo Revell.\nCredits: Didrichsen Art Museum\nVisit a sauna (obviously!)\nSuffering from travel fatigue?

Ladulle.fi offers the latest info about the condition of tracks around the country.\nCredits : Mikko Huotari\nSki season in Lapland lasts typically from November until April. In spring, ski days are long and sunsets are mesmerizing.\nCredits: Harri Lindfors\nWatch nature come alive on a hike\nSigns of spring usually crop up in late March in southern Finland, and it's hard to overstate the pull of the warmer season. As the snow starts to melt, the country's forests come alive, offering many lovely locations for nature walks, hikes and the Finnish pastime of forest bathing. In Helsinki, don't miss the blossoming of the Roihuvuori cherry tree orchard, one of the area's most beloved signs of spring.\nThe Roihuvuori cherry orchard is part of a garden inspired by Japan and blooms every May.\nGrab your binoculars and go bird-watching\nThe sound of birds chirping is a blissful reminder that nature is reawakening. Every spring, nearly 250 species of birds return to Finland from their long winter spent down south. If you're interested in bird-watching, the town of Kuusamo \u2013 and it's expansive taiga forests \u2013 is regarded as one of the best in Finland, while the Coast and Archipelago region offers enthusiasts the opportunity to observe Charadriiformes, which can often be spotted in the coastal areas near the Baltic Sea. But even the greater Helsinki area offers ample birding in spots such as Old Town Bay, Viikki, Lauttasaari and Laajalahti in Espoo \u2013 all of which can be easily accessed by public transportation.

The season for this magical phenomenon is particularly long in Lapland, where the Aurora is most visible from the end of August to April. According to research, the lights are visible every second night when the skies are clear, so you may be able to spot them about 200 nights per year. To boost your chances of seeing the show during your trip, hire an aurora guide or join an organised tour. You can even stay overnight in a specially designed glass hut! Read more about sleeping under the Northern Lights here.\nFinland is one of the best places in the world to see \u2013 and sleep under \u2013 the Northern Lights.\nCredits: Mika Vahtera\nExperience peace and quiet on the Coast and Archipelago\nAs temperatures rise, the islands of the world\u2019s largest archipelago come to life, with one exception: locals are few and visitors are even fewer! Springtime here is still an undiscovered gem, allowing the few people who venture out some serious peace and quiet. The good news? Year-round accommodations can still be found on the islands of Hailuoto near Oulu, on Ut\u00f6 in the Turku archipelago, on the \u00c5land Islands and on Bar\u00f6sund, an island near Inkoo.

People, too, come alive after the long winter, and events like Easter and Vappu (1st of May) celebrate the upcoming season.\nExperience the magic of spring for yourself with this list of the top things to do in Finland from March through May.\nHit the slopes in the spring sun\nMany ski resorts remain open and cross-country skiing tracks are typically in great condition. One of the more curious elements of the Finnish spring ski season is the sudden appearance of great parties. If you\u2019re looking to dance your ski boots off, head to Tahko in the eastern part of Lakeland. And while the Ruka and Levi ski resorts are known for their spectacularly fun 1st of May Labour Day parties, even quieter locations such as Pyh\u00e4 offer opportunities for festivities. Regardless of where you go, apr\u00e8s ski in the spring sunshine is a can't-miss activity.\nCross-country skiing is a popular spring activity. Ladulle.fi offers the latest info about the condition of tracks around the country.\nCredits : Mikko Huotari\nSki season in Lapland lasts typically from November until April. In spring, ski days are long and sunsets are mesmerizing.\nCredits: Harri Lindfors\nWatch nature come alive on a hike\nSigns of spring usually crop up in late March in southern Finland, and it's hard to overstate the pull of the warmer season. As the snow starts to melt, the country's forests come alive, offering many lovely locations for nature walks, hikes and the Finnish pastime of forest bathing.

People, too, come alive after the long winter, and events like Easter and Vappu (1st of May) celebrate the upcoming season.\nExperience the magic of spring for yourself with this list of the top things to do in Finland from March through May.\nHit the slopes in the spring sun\nMany ski resorts remain open and cross-country skiing tracks are typically in great condition. One of the more curious elements of the Finnish spring ski season is the sudden appearance of great parties. If you\u2019re looking to dance your ski boots off, head to Tahko in the eastern part of Lakeland. And while the Ruka and Levi ski resorts are known for their spectacularly fun 1st of May Labour Day parties, even quieter locations such as Pyh\u00e4 offer opportunities for festivities. Regardless of where you go, apr\u00e8s ski in the spring sunshine is a can't-miss activity.\nCross-country skiing is a popular spring activity. Ladulle.fi offers the latest info about the condition of tracks around the country.\nCredits : Mikko Huotari\nSki season in Lapland lasts typically from November until April. In spring, ski days are long and sunsets are mesmerizing.\nCredits: Harri Lindfors\nWatch nature come alive on a hike\nSigns of spring usually crop up in late March in southern Finland, and it's hard to overstate the pull of the warmer season. As the snow starts to melt, the country's forests come alive, offering many lovely locations for nature walks, hikes and the Finnish pastime of forest bathing. In Helsinki, don't miss the blossoming of the Roihuvuori cherry tree orchard, one of the area's most beloved signs of spring.\nThe Roihuvuori cherry orchard is part of a garden inspired by Japan and blooms every May.\nGrab your binoculars and go bird-watching\nThe sound of birds chirping is a blissful reminder that nature is reawakening.
